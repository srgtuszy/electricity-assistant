# Green Go: Empowering Sustainable Practices in Hospitality

Green Go is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to promote eco-friendly practices in the hospitality industry. Our project consists of three main components:

1. **Digital Twin**: The Lyf digital property control panel allows hotel managers to monitor and control various aspects of their property in a virtual environment. By simulating real-world scenarios, managers can optimize energy consumption, reduce waste, and improve overall efficiency.

2. **Hotel Dashboard**: Our real-time property dashboard provides hotel staff with a centralized platform to monitor and manage various aspects of their property. From energy consumption to guest satisfaction, the dashboard offers valuable insights and actionable data to help hotels operate more sustainably.

3. **Mobile App**: The Green Go guest experience app is designed to encourage sustainable habits among hotel guests. Through gamification and personalized recommendations, the app helps guests make eco-friendly choices during their stay, such as reducing water usage, conserving energy, and minimizing waste.

By leveraging cutting-edge technology and data-driven insights, Green Go empowers hotels to adopt sustainable practices, reduce their environmental impact, and enhance the guest experience. Our project showcases the potential of innovative solutions in driving positive change in the hospitality industry.
